# Tic Tac Toe
A small project to dust off my C/C++ skills in preparation for a fun little side project I plan to work on.

## Huh?
Ever since I started working with Golang at a professional level, I've fallen more and more in love with the language. However, when I tried to use it for personal or side projects—even as a one-off proof of concept—I just couldn't feel the same way as I do when using it at work.

This gives me a good opportunity to reopen the forgotten vault of C/C++.
